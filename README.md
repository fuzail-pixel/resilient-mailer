# Resilient Mailer

A robust email-sending service built in JavaScript that simulates real-world email dispatch infrastructure with built-in resiliency features like retries, fallback, circuit breaking, rate limiting, idempotency, logging, and a basic queue processor.

## Overview

This service is designed to demonstrate how to send emails reliably even in unstable conditions using common patterns like:

- Retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback provider switching
- Circuit breaker to avoid overloading failing services
- Idempotency to prevent duplicates
- Basic in-memory rate limiting
- Logging for observability
- A queue system to handle multiple email requests in batch

All functionality is implemented using vanilla JavaScript with minimal external libraries and mock providers to simulate different failure/success scenarios.

---

## Features

### Resiliency
- **Retry Logic**: Retries sending email up to 3 times with exponential backoff delays.
- **Fallback Providers**: If one provider fails, the service switches to the next available.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatically disables a provider after repeated failures, preventing cascading failures.

### Infrastructure Support
- **Rate Limiting**: Allows only a fixed number of emails per provider per minute.
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate email sends using a SHA256 hash of email payload.
- **Logging**: Structured and timestamped logs for all events and actions.
- **Queue Processor**: Sends multiple emails in sequence to simulate batch processing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v18+ (tested with v20.18.0)

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resilient-mailer.git
cd resilient-mailer
```

No external dependencies are required.

---

## Usage

### Single Email Send

```bash
node index.js
```

This sends a single hardcoded email using available providers with all resilience mechanisms.

### Batch Send via Queue

To simulate a queue-based processing system:

1. Edit `QueueProcessor.js` to define your email batch.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   node QueueProcessor.js
   ```

---

## Testing

This project uses basic assertion-based test files. To run:

```bash
node tests/ratelimiter.test.js
node tests/idempotency.test.js
node tests/circuitbreaker.test.js
node tests/EmailService.test.js
```

Each test will output pass/fail messages to the console.

---

## Assumptions

* Providers are mocked and randomly simulate failures.
* All data (e.g., sent records) is stored locally in a JSON file (`sentEmails.json`).
* No database or external message queue is integrated — this is a simulation.
* Duplicate detection is based on hash of `to`, `subject`, and `body`.

---

## Future Improvements

* Migrate to TypeScript for stricter type safety.
* Replace file-based store with Redis or a database.
* Introduce an actual job queue (e.g., Bull, RabbitMQ).
* Support real email APIs (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).
* Add CLI interface or REST API wrapper.
* Implement monitoring dashboard.
